				<p><b>FOUNDING GANGA & KRISHNAMURTHY TEMPLE</b><br>
				<p>Ganga & Krishnamurthy Temple is being founded by me, R.V. Nagaveni M.D., M.S., to honor my charitable paternal Grandmother Gangamma and also my Great Grandfather who treated her well. I am commencing with one idol of Naga. The Naga idol
                    will be consecrated to enable women to request God that they get their family property and do charity. In the case of forebears’ property, that they be able to get the property, do charity and fulfill the wishes of the deceased.
                    <p>We shall bring the idol to places such as homes or other places where devotees request a service to be performed. The service will also be available virtually.
                          <p>Ganga and Krishnamurthy Temple is named after my paternal Grandmother Gangamma and her Father Krishnamurthy. She was named after the Water Goddess Ganga. Grandmother Gangamma was a very intelligent, loving, non-discriminating
                                    and charitable woman.
                                    <p>Gangamma's father, Advocate Krishnamurthy, walking 2222 miles, made a pilgrimage from the village Kadaba, Karnataka state, Bharatha, to the city of Kaashi on the bank of the holy river Ganga at the confluence of three
                                        rivers. Upon his return, his second child was born. He named the baby 'Ganga'.

                                                        Venkanniah, a great Samskritha Scholar and her charitable father in law, Narayanappa, the head of a wealthy joint family, passed away fifteen days apart. Her unjust brothers-in-law, discriminating
                                                        against her as a woman, greedily grabbed her rightful share of the property depriving her of a livelihood. They made a wealthy and charitable woman poverty stricken. Her two children were my father,
                                                        three-year-old [Venkata] Ramiah, and his younger sister. By then, Gangamma's kindly father, Krishnamurthy, an advocate, had passed away.
